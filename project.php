<h2>Welcome to My Poject</h2>
<p>My personal portfolio website serves as a digital showcase of my skills, projects, and experiences. 
    Designed with a clean and modern layout, the site provides a seamless user experience while reflecting my personal brand and aesthetic.
    The main goal of this project was to create a platform where I could present my work, share insights about my journey, and make it easier for potential clients or employers to connect with me. 
    It features sections like an about me, resume, skills, projects, and contact form â€” all crafted with responsiveness in mind, ensuring a smooth experience across all devices.</p>
